## Run anything in production, _in seconds_

Write up a Dockerfile and set up CI with our guides, or start with one of our templates using Lunni CLI. When you're ready to deploy, paste your docker-compose.yml file into Lunni dashboard and hit Deploy – that's all that you need to do.

## Host on your own servers

We don't host your data – it's all hosted on servers you own. This makes it easy to comply with privacy regulations like GDPR. Lunni runs on AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean – and anywhere else Docker does.
