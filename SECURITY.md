# Reporting Security Issues

Our team and community take security bugs in Lunni seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email <lunni-security@aedge.dev> and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

We will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, we will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

This project is currently maintained by a team of volunteers on a reasonable-effort basis, so please give us at least 90 days to work on a fix before public exposure.


## Third-party modules

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module:

- For JavaScript packages, run `npm show [packagename]` to see the package maintainer email.

- For Python packages, open project page on PyPI and look for the **Author** link in the left sidebar.
